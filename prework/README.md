# Prework - Ops 102: Intro to Computer Operations

This is the mandatory pre-work for Ops 102. When this course nears its start date, you will be invited to an online portal named Canvas where you can confirm that you've completed this pre-work and claim credit.

Start on the pre-work as soon as you can and be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to complete it.

> **Note: All pre-work is due before start of first class**

## Ops Lab Kit

 - Obtain and unbox your lab kit from Code Fellows. Ensure all items are present. Test computer, monitor, keyboard, and mouse. The computer should display a short startup sequence that may result in a boot failure error if no operating system is installed by default. This is expected. We will take care of that as a part of class. 

> IMPORTANT: As a safety precaution, do NOT open the lab kit PC's case and remove components until instructed to do so during class.
